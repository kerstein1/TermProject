    <h2>About:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>My website is meant to inform everyday consumers about the importance of saving for their future, especially
            in different stages of their lives. I will use <a
                href="https://promo.bankofamerica.com/familylife/journey/"> Bank of America’s </a> life journey model,
            which identifies early adulthood, parenting, caregivers, and seniors as major milestones in their clients’
            life. Additionally, to provide a more holistic outlook and pieces of information I will also include
            research and facts from other institutions besides banks.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What is the objective of your website?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>My website's objective is to teach people about the importance of planning for every stage of their life. It
            is never too early to start saving or creating a financial plan for the future. There will be tips on saving
            strategies and how to save when you’re trying to save to buy an apartment after graduation.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Who is your target audience set?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Even though, I will include a summary about each stage of peoples’ life I want to mainly focus on teen,
            college students, and early adulthood (recent graduates) I will research and identify three major dilemmas
            that recent graduates are undergoing and provide saving tips.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1st & 2nd Page: Teen - On the first page I will specify the importance of saving young. Highlighting the
            benefits of saving young and on the second page I want to focus on specific tips that teens can use in order
            to save and not spend money. (E.g. Save 10% from each paycheck).
        </li>
        <li>
            3rd & 4th Page: College students - I will provide information on how to start saving by providing specific
            information about opening bank accounts and the decisions that come into it. For instance, when you compare
            bank accounts and do research you can find out more information
        </li>
        <li>
            5th Page: Early Adulthood - I will focus on describing short-term planning vs. long-term planning. For
            instance, saving to go on a vacation vs. buying a house, and providing tips on best saving practices. (E.g.
            how to save when you are paying rent as well as spending to go out).

        </li>
