            <ul>Becoming Financially Independent</ul>
            <p>This is usually the time when college students venture out into the world and start figuring things out for themselves. One of the most exciting times in a persons' life, but also one of the scariest. Especially, if you have never talked about financial wellness before, the world can appear scary. Below are a few tips on how to open your first bank account as well as select where you want to start building your credit.</p>
            <ul>Opening Your Own Bank Account</ul>
            <p>Opening your first bank account without the supervision of your parents is quite exciting. But usually one gets a bank account either because your parents use that bank or because its in close proximity of your school.</p>
            <p>All of those reasons make a lot of sense, but there are other banks that have a lot of benefits that one might have never thought about.</p>
